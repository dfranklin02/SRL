Learners who frequently use a variety of strategies to learn and remember information might ask themselves things like, “Is this the best way to learn this type of information?” or “How can I be doing this activity differently to enhance my learning?” By continually thinking about the strategies needed to learn information in their courses, learners can develop a bigger strategy “toolkit” from which to learn. To improve how well they understand concepts and material, learners may elaborate on concepts they are learning, quiz themselves to check their comprehension, and make flash cards or summaries to help them remember information. 
Because developing an array of learning strategies is important for all learners in college, you might be interested in learning more about how frequently you use these types of strategies. If so, we encourage you to take the SRL survey at demo.daacs.net.

## WHY is time management important?

By consistently using strategies to optimize how well you learn information, it is likely that you will:
* feel better prepared for upcoming tests
* have a more thorough understanding of how topics relate to each other
* feel more confident in your academic skills and knowledge
* experience less anxiety when taking tests or completing other work

However, many learners do not use these types of strategies. If you do not use them on a consistent basis, you may:

* doubt yourself and your abilities, which relates to a Fixed mindset
* feel overwhelmed by the amount and/or type of material you need to learn
* give up on studying and accept that you will do poorly on a test
* be embarrassed when you cannot demonstrate knowledge of a topic

The scenario below illustrates some of the difficulties that learners can experience when they do use strategies to enhance their learning and recall of course information:
> Steven, a second year college student, was feeling overwhelmed and defeated while studying for his math test. Steven decided to study by only reading all of the chapters that were going to be on the test. While studying, he realized that he was confused and did not understand what he was reading. Instead of going back and trying to understand the section, or using a different source to learn the information, he continued to read the entire chapter. Steven thought to himself, “I don’t get this stuff, but I don’t know what else I can do!” He got frustrated and thought to himself that there had to be a better way to study. “I have to figure out a good plan for studying. Maybe I should do practice problems and use visuals instead of just reading all of the chapters.” After seeking out help from his advisor, Steven began to look through his notes for the main concepts and practice problems that might appear on exams. By expanding his repertoire of strategies to study, Steven was setting himself up to better focus and learn the material. 

**Key Thought:** Steven did not realize that he had some control in this situation. It was important that he understand the need to learn different types of study strategies and to seek out assistance from his advisor. By learning and using these strategies, he will likely experience greater success in remembering the information.

## HOW can I improve my managing understanding skills?
All learners can benefit from improving their time management! Click on the **Learn**, **See**, and/or **Do** buttons to help develop your repertoire of time management strategies.

## How can using effective learning strategies influence the way you think, feel, and act?
Learners may differ in whether they FREQUENTLY, PARTIALLY, or INFREQUENTLY use an array of strategies to learn course information. The figure below illustrates the influence of learning strategy use on outcomes and feelings learners might experience. Just note that these outcomes will often differ depending on how frequently and how skilled they are in managing their learning and understanding. **In what ways do the following descriptions reflect you as a learner?**
